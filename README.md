# SteerClear

**SteerClear** is a self-built, remote-controlled autonomous vehicle designed for smooth and intelligent navigation. Using cutting-edge technologies like neural networks for decision-making, **SteerClear** integrates real-time sensor data and image processing to effortlessly avoid obstacles and choose optimal paths.

## Key Components
- **Motor Control & Sensor Processing**: Powered by advanced sensors, the system processes data to detect nearby obstacles and adjust the vehicleâ€™s movement accordingly.
- **Image Processing & Object Detection**: Utilizing a camera, **SteerClear** recognizes and responds to objects in its environment, ensuring smart navigation.
- **Neural Network Decision-Making**: Combines sensor and image data to make intelligent decisions, directing the vehicle in real-time.

## Features
- **Real-Time Control**: Option to manually control the vehicle, with instant feedback and response.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: **SteerClear** can independently navigate, leveraging sensors and object detection to avoid obstacles and find optimal routes.
- **Object Detection**: Capable of recognizing objects in its path and responding dynamically.
- **Modular Design**: Built for flexibility, allowing easy integration of additional features or sensors.

## How It Works
1. **Sensors** on the vehicle continuously monitor the surroundings, providing real-time data on obstacle proximity.
2. A **camera** captures live video, which is processed to detect objects and interpret the environment.
3. Data from the sensors and camera is fed into a **neural network**, which intelligently decides the next course of action for the vehicle.
4. The vehicle autonomously adjusts its movements, ensuring a safe and efficient path forward.
